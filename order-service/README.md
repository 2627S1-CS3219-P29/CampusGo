# Order Service - Local Setup Guide

This guide covers everything required to spin up the Order Service, seed it with dummy errand data, and test the API routes locally.

Stack: Deno + Oak, Prisma 8 (`@prisma/orm-postgres`), PostgreSQL 18, the same as the user and supplier services.

## 1. Environment Setup
Copy the order service variables from the root `.env.example` into the root `.env` (compose reads it; no `order-service/.env` is needed):
```env
ORDER_DB_URL=postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@order_db:5432/orders
ORDER_DB_PW=mysecretpassword
```
`JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` must also be set, since the order service verifies the access tokens the user service signs.

## 2. Start the Service
From the repository root (the folder containing `compose.yaml`):
```docker compose --profile dev up -d --build order_db order_dev```

`order_dev` waits for the database, applies the schema (`deno task db:update_dev`) and starts with live reload. It is reachable as `order_api:3000` inside Docker and at `http://localhost:8004` from your machine.

## 3. Seed Data
Seed the database with dummy UI testing data:
```docker compose --profile dev exec order_dev deno task seed```

## 4. Changing the Schema
1. Edit `src/prisma/contract.prisma`
2. Regenerate `contract.json` and `contract.d.ts`: `docker compose --profile dev exec order_dev deno task contract:emit`
3. Apply it to the database: `docker compose --profile dev exec order_dev deno task db:update`



## API Testing Guide
-----------------

Authentication: every endpoint needs a signed-in user. Log in through the user service (POST http://localhost:8000/api/public/user/auth/login) and send the returned access token on every request:
- Header: "Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>"
- Without a valid token the service returns 401. The requester, caller and their roles always come from the token, so requesterId, callerId and userRole are not sent in the body.

Validation: request bodies are checked; invalid or unknown fields return 400 with the reason per field, e.g. `{ "error": "invalid request body", "fields": { "creditBounty": ["Must be at least 1"] } }`.

URLs: through the edge (as the frontend does) use http://localhost:8000/api/public/order/orders. The service is also exposed directly at http://localhost:8004/public/orders for debugging.

List Orders (GET)
- Method: GET
- URL: http://localhost:8000/api/public/order/orders?scope=open&page=1
- Query parameters (all optional):
    - scope: open (default) = errands a courier can accept (open, not expired, not your own); requested = errands you created; delivering = errands you are the courier on; all = every order (admins only, 403 otherwise)
    - status: comma separated, e.g. status=DELIVERED,CANCELLED,EXPIRED for past orders, or OPEN,ACCEPTED,COLLECTED for active ones
    - page: 20 orders per page, newest first
- Result: same shape as the supplier list, e.g.
        { "data": [ ...orders ], "pagination": { "page": 1, "limit": 20, "total": 32, "totalPage": 2 } }
  Orders that are due to expire are marked EXPIRED before listing (see Expiry). Invalid or unknown query parameters return 400.

Fetch One Order (GET)
- Method: GET
- URL: http://localhost:8000/api/public/order/orders/:id
- Result: 200 with the order. The requester, the assigned courier and admins can always see it; anyone else only while it is OPEN, otherwise 404.

Create a New Order (POST)
- Method: POST
- URL: http://localhost:8000/api/public/order/orders
- Headers: Must include "Idempotency-Key" with a unique string (e.g., "test-req-123") for deduplication.
- Body: (JSON)
    Sample, picking up from a supplier:
        {
          "pickupType": "SUPPLIER",
          "supplierId": 3,
          "dropoffLocationId": 18,
          "dropoffFloor": 3,
          "dropoffRoom": "#03-12",
          "itemDescription": "Printed CS3230 assignment",
          "creditBounty": 5,
          "additionalDetails": "Pages 1-20, double sided",
          "expiresInMinutes": 120
        }
    Picking up from a building instead: "pickupType": "BUILDING" with pickupLocationId, pickupFloor and an optional pickupRoom, and no supplierId.
    Buildings are location ids from the supplier service (GET /public/supplier/locations); a deleted or unknown one returns 400 "Building not found", and 503 if the supplier service is down. Floors are whole numbers: ground is 1, basements are negative (-1 = B1), there is no 0. Rooms are optional, up to 50 characters.
    A supplier pickup is a preset spot: the order takes the supplier's building and floor. The order service also stores readable snapshots, e.g. pickupLocation "Printer @ Com 2, Com 2, Level 1" and dropoffLocation "Com 2, Level 3, #03-12".
    expiresInMinutes is optional: the errand's deadline, a whole number from 15 to 1440 (24 hours). Left out, it defaults to 24 hours. See Expiry.
    User ids (requesterId, courierId) are integers taken from the access token.
- Result: Returns a 201 Created status with the newly generated errand, including its auto-assigned UUID and OPEN status. If sent a second time with the exact same Idempotency-Key header, it will safely return a 200 OK with "deduplicated": true instead of double-charging.

Update Order Status (PATCH)
- Method: PATCH
- URL: http://localhost:8000/api/public/order/orders/:id/status (Replace :id with an actual UUID from the GET request)
- Body: (JSON)
    Sample:
        {
          "targetStatus": "ACCEPTED"
        }
    targetStatus is one of ACCEPTED, COLLECTED, DELIVERED, CANCELLED:
    - ACCEPTED: anyone but the requester, while the order is OPEN and before its deadline
    - COLLECTED: the assigned courier, before the deadline
    - DELIVERED: the assigned courier, before the deadline plus the grace period; the credits go to the courier
    - CANCELLED: the requester, while the order is OPEN or ACCEPTED; the credits go back to the requester. Nobody (not even an admin) can cancel once the item is collected.
- Result: Returns a 200 OK with the newly updated state. Errors: 403 when the caller may not make the change, 400 or 409 when the order is in the wrong status, 410 when it has expired.
- Every status change is a single conditional database update, so two requests racing on the same order (e.g. two couriers accepting at once) cannot both succeed; the loser gets 409.

Expiry
- The requester and courier share one deadline (expiresAt). An OPEN or ACCEPTED order not collected by then expires.
- A COLLECTED order past its deadline is overdue but can still be delivered; it expires only after a further grace period (collectedGraceMinutes in src/config.ts, 2 hours), so a late courier holding the item is not cut off straight away.
- Expired orders refund the requester. A background job expires due orders every minute, and they are also checked before any order is read or changed.
