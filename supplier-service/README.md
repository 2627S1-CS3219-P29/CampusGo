# Supplier Service

Stores the places on campus that errands can be requested from: **stores**, **facilities**
and **landmarks**. It covers FR 5 (admin management), FR 6 (listing, search, sort, filter)
and NFR 4 to 6.

## Database choice: PostgreSQL

We use one PostgreSQL 18 database per service (`supplier_db`). The supplier service is the
only thing that reads or writes it. Other services go through its API.

| FoC need | Why PostgreSQL fits |
| --- | --- |
| **The data has a fixed structure.** Every supplier has the same six fields from FR 5 (name, type, location, description, opening time, closing time). No supplier needs extra fields that others lack. | A fixed table schema matches this. A document database's flexible schema adds nothing here and would let bad records in. |
| **The rules are relational.** A store or facility sits *at* a landmark. A landmark still referenced by stores cannot be deleted or re-typed (FR 5.10, 5.11). | A foreign key from `locationId` to `supplier.id` makes the database enforce these rules instead of every code path. |
| **Validation belongs in the data layer.** Names must be unique (FR 5.5.1), type must be one of three values (FR 5.5.5), location is required for stores and facilities (FR 5.5.3), times must be valid (FR 5.5.6). | Unique indexes, `CHECK` constraints and the native `time` type reject bad rows even when the API has a bug. |
| **The main queries search, filter, sort and paginate.** | SQL does all four in one indexed query (see *Query patterns*). |
| **The data is small and mostly read.** It starts at 100 suppliers and may grow to 1,000 (NFR 5), with at most 40 req/s at peak (NFR 4). | A single Postgres instance handles this easily, so we don't need to shard or add a cache. If we ever need to scale, read replicas are the next step. |
| **Changes that touch several rows must be atomic.** Soft-deleting a landmark also soft-deletes its stores and writes audit rows. | Transactions make these multi-row changes all-or-nothing. |
| **The team already knows it.** | The user service already uses Postgres with Prisma 8. Reusing the same tools, migrations workflow and Docker setup saves time. |

We considered MongoDB and rejected it. Its strength is flexible, nested documents, and
supplier data has neither. We would also have to rebuild referential integrity and
case-insensitive uniqueness in application code.

### Why a single `supplier` table with a self-reference

In the mockups a landmark (e.g. `COM3`) is both a supplier you can pick and the location
of other suppliers (`Smooy@COM3`, `The Terrace@COM3`). Keeping all three types in one
table means:

- the supplier list, search and filters query one table, with no `UNION`s;
- a store's location is simply its landmark's `id`, and the foreign key guarantees that
  landmark exists;
- changing a landmark's type or deleting it is blocked while stores still point at it
  (FR 5.10). The FK uses `ON DELETE RESTRICT`.

### Supplier metadata

| Field | Stored as | Rules |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Name | `text` | Required, not blank. Unique across all rows, including deleted ones (`UNIQUE (name)`). A second index, `UNIQUE (lower(name)) WHERE "deletedAt" IS NULL`, also stops live suppliers from differing only by case. Because each name is unique and each row has exactly one `locationId`, a name maps to at most one location (FR 5.5.2). |
| Type | `text`, limited by a `CHECK` to `store`, `facility`, `landmark` | Anything else is rejected (FR 5.5.5). |
| Location | `locationId` pointing at `supplier.id` | Required for stores and facilities, forbidden for landmarks. Enforced by a `CHECK` (FR 5.5.3). |
| Description | `text`, nullable | Optional. |
| Opening hours | `opensAt` and `closesAt`, both `time` | Must be both set or both empty. Landmarks can't have hours. `closesAt < opensAt` means the supplier is open past midnight. The `time` type rejects invalid values such as `25:00` (FR 5.5.6). Times are Singapore local time. |
| Who and when | `createdBy`, `updatedBy`, `createdAt`, `updatedAt` | User ids come from the user service's JWT. They are not foreign keys, because the users table lives in another database. |
| Deleted | `deletedAt` | Soft delete, see below. |

### Constraints enforced by the database

These were each tested against a real Postgres 18 instance:

| Constraint | Rejects |
| --- | --- |
| `supplier_name_key` (unique constraint) | Reusing any existing name exactly, even a deleted supplier's |
| `supplier_name_active` (unique index) | Adding `com3` while `COM3` exists |
| `supplier_location_by_type` | A store or facility without a location, or a landmark with one |
| `supplier_hours_paired` | An opening time with no closing time, or the reverse |
| `supplier_landmark_no_hours` | A landmark with opening hours |
| `supplier_name_not_blank` | Empty or whitespace-only names |
| `supplier_type_check` (generated from the enum) | Types other than the three allowed |
| `supplier_locationId_fkey` | Hard-deleting a landmark that stores still reference |

### Enforced in the service layer

A `CHECK` constraint can only see one row, so these rules live in the API:

- **`locationId` must point at a live landmark**, not at a store or a deleted row.
- **Deleting or re-typing a landmark (FR 5.10, 5.11).** Changing the type of a landmark
  that stores point at is rejected. Deleting a landmark soft-deletes its stores and
  facilities in the same transaction, which is how we read "cascade" in FR 5.11.
- **Deleting a supplier with an ongoing errand (FR 5.8).** Before deleting, the service
  asks the order service whether any open errand references the supplier (or, for a
  landmark, any supplier located at it), and rejects the delete with an explanation if
  one does. *The order service doesn't exist yet, so
  [src/util/orderService.ts](src/util/orderService.ts) currently always allows the
  delete. Connecting it is a one-function change once the order service has the
  endpoint.*

Every write runs in one transaction that **locks the rows it depends on**. For example,
creating a store locks its landmark `FOR SHARE`, and deleting a landmark locks it
`FOR UPDATE`. A store can therefore never be created at a landmark that is being deleted
at the same moment.

### Soft delete and preserving history (FR 5.9)

A delete sets `deletedAt` rather than removing the row, so supplier ids stored in old
errands still resolve. Every read filters on `"deletedAt" IS NULL`. Because `name` is
unique across all rows, a deleted supplier's name stays reserved. The API tells the admin
so (`409`, *"COM3" belongs to a deleted supplier, choose another name*). We chose this
over renaming the row on delete so that old errands keep showing the name the supplier
had at the time.

As a second safeguard, the order service should also copy the supplier's name and
location into the errand when it is created. A completed errand then shows the details
as they were at that time, even if the supplier is renamed later.

### Audit log (FR 5.12, NFR 6)

Every create, update or delete appends a row to `supplierAuditLog`, holding who made the
change and a JSON snapshot of the supplier. It is written in the same transaction as the
change, so a supplier can't change without leaving a log entry. The service only ever
inserts into this table.


## Query patterns

All list queries run as **one SQL statement** in
[src/prisma/suppliers.ts](src/prisma/suppliers.ts). Each filter is optional, and leaving
it out turns its condition off, so search, filters, sort and pagination combine freely
(FR 6.7). Deleted suppliers are always excluded.

| Query | Used for | How it runs |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Get one supplier by id | Supplier details (FR 6.1), order service lookups | Primary key |
| Search by name | Search box (FR 6.2) | Case-insensitive substring match: `lower(name) LIKE '%' \|\| $q \|\| '%'`. `%` and `_` in the input are escaped, so they match literally. At 1,000 rows a scan takes well under a millisecond. A `pg_trgm` index is the next step if the data ever grows much larger |
| Filter by type, one or more | Store / Facility / Landmark chips (FR 6.4.1) | `type = ANY($types)`, using the index on `type` |
| Filter to suppliers open now | "Open now" filter (FR 6.4.2) | Compares the current Singapore time, `(now() AT TIME ZONE 'Asia/Singapore')::time`, with `opensAt` and `closesAt`, including hours that run past midnight. Suppliers with no hours listed are left out. Every result also carries an `isOpenNow` flag |
| List suppliers at a landmark | Landmark details, delete and re-type checks (FR 5.10, 5.11) | `locationId = $id`, using the index on `locationId` |
| Sort by name, A–Z or Z–A | Sort control (FR 6.3.1) | `ORDER BY lower(name)`, ties broken by `id` so pages stay stable |
| Paginate | Supplier list | `LIMIT`/`OFFSET`, plus a `count(*)` with the same `WHERE` for the total. Offset paging is fine at 1,000 rows and lets the UI jump straight to any page |
| Location name | Showing "Smooy @ COM3" | A self-join on `supplier`, so no second request is needed |

## API

The gateway serves the service at `/api/public/supplier/…` through the edge
(`localhost:8000`), or `localhost:8080/public/supplier/…` directly. Other services reach
the private routes on the gateway's private listener, `localhost:8081/private/supplier/…`.

| Method and path | Who can call it | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /public/suppliers` | Any signed-in user | List live suppliers. Query parameters below |
| `GET /public/suppliers/:id` | Any signed-in user | One live supplier. 404 if it doesn't exist or was deleted |
| `POST /public/suppliers` | Admin | Create a supplier. **201** with the supplier and a `Location` header |
| `PATCH /public/suppliers/:id` | Admin | Change some fields. **200** with the updated supplier |
| `DELETE /public/suppliers/:id` | Admin | Soft-delete a supplier, and everything at it if it's a landmark. **200** `{"deletedIds": [...]}` |
| `GET /private/suppliers/:id` | Other services only | One supplier, **including deleted ones**, e.g. the order service showing an old errand. Not reachable through the public gateway |
| `GET /public/health` | Anyone | Liveness check |

**List query parameters.** All are optional. Unknown or invalid parameters return a 400
that names the bad field.

| Parameter | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | `q=mart` | Name contains this text, ignoring case (up to 100 characters) |
| `type` | `type=store,facility` | Any of `store`, `facility`, `landmark`, comma-separated |
| `openNow` | `openNow=true` | Only suppliers open right now |
| `locationId` | `locationId=14` | Only suppliers at this landmark |
| `sort` | `sort=-name` | `name` for A–Z (the default), `-name` for Z–A |
| `page`, `pageSize` | `page=2&pageSize=20` | 1-based page number. Page size defaults to 20, maximum 100 |

**List response:**

```json
{
  "items": [{
    "id": 17, "name": "Smooy", "type": "store",
    "description": "Frozen yoghurt within The Terrace",
    "location": { "id": 14, "name": "COM3" },
    "openingHours": { "opensAt": "09:00", "closesAt": "17:00" },
    "isOpenNow": false,
    "createdAt": "2026-09-28T16:25:28.607Z", "updatedAt": "2026-09-28T16:25:28.607Z", "deletedAt": null
  }],
  "page": 1, "pageSize": 20, "total": 6, "totalPages": 1
}
```

### Creating and updating suppliers

`POST` takes the fields below. `PATCH` takes any subset of them, and sending `null`
clears an optional field. Any other field, such as `id` or `createdBy`, is rejected, so
admins can't set server-managed columns.

| Field | Rules |
| --- | --- |
| `name` | Required. Trimmed, 1–100 characters, unique ignoring case |
| `type` | Required. `store`, `facility` or `landmark` |
| `description` | Optional, up to 500 characters. Blank is stored as `null` |
| `locationId` | Required for stores and facilities, and must be a live landmark. Not allowed for landmarks |
| `openingHours` | Optional `{ "opensAt": "HH:MM", "closesAt": "HH:MM" }` in 24-hour time. The two times must differ, and `closesAt` earlier than `opensAt` means open past midnight. Not allowed for landmarks |

On `PATCH`, the rules are checked against **the stored supplier with the patch applied**.
Changing a store to a landmark therefore also requires `"locationId": null` and
`"openingHours": null`.

**Errors name the fields at fault** (FR 5.5.4), so the UI can show each message next to
its input:

```json
{ "error": "invalid supplier", "fields": { "locationId": ["A store must be located at a landmark"] } }
```

| Status | When |
| --- | --- |
| 400 | A field is missing or invalid, or an unknown field was sent. Details are in `fields`, or in `errors` for problems that aren't about one field |
| 404 | No live supplier with that id |
| 409 | The name is taken (by a live or deleted supplier); a landmark that others are located at would change type (FR 5.10); or an ongoing errand blocks a delete (FR 5.8) |

### Access control with identity from the user service

The user service handles login. It signs a short-lived (15 minute) **access token**, a
JWT, that carries the user id (`sub`) and their roles (`role: ["admin", "requestor",
"courier"]`). The frontend sends it on every call as `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

The supplier service **checks the token itself** in
[src/middleware/auth.ts](src/middleware/auth.ts), without calling the user service:

1. It verifies the signature with the access-token secret shared with the user service,
   and checks that the issuer is `user-service`. A forged or edited token, such as one
   where someone added `admin` to their roles, fails the signature check.
2. It reads the user id and roles from the verified token.
3. Each route declares the roles it needs. Browsing needs none beyond being signed in;
   create, update and delete need `admin`.

| Situation | Response |
| --- | --- |
| No token, expired token, bad signature or wrong issuer | **401** `{"error": "missing bearer token"}` or `"access token expired"` or `"access token is of invalid format"`. The frontend refreshes the token and retries |
| Valid token without the required role, e.g. a courier trying to create a supplier | **403** `{"error": "insufficient permissions to perform action"}` |

Every 401 and 403 is logged with the user id (when known), method and path (FR 4.3.2).

**Why check tokens locally instead of asking the user service on every request:**

- **Speed.** Browsing suppliers is the busiest path (NFR 4). Checking a signature takes
  microseconds and adds no network call.
- **Independence.** The supplier list keeps working even if the user service is
  restarting.
- **The downside is a delay on role changes.** A role change or account suspension
  takes effect only when the user's current access token expires, at most 15 minutes
  later. We accept that for supplier data. If it becomes a problem, the user service
  could keep a list of revoked tokens.

Because the secret is shared, any service that holds it could also *sign* tokens. A
stronger setup has the user service sign with a private key (RS256 or EdDSA) and publish
the matching public key, so other services can verify tokens but never create them.
We've noted this as a later improvement to the user service.

### Example calls

These were run against the stack, using real tokens from the user service's login:

```bash
TOKEN=...   # accessToken from POST /api/public/user/auth/login
API=http://localhost:8080/public/supplier/suppliers

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API?q=mart"                          # search
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API?type=store,facility&sort=-name"  # filter + sort
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API?openNow=true"                    # open right now
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API?locationId=14"                   # at a landmark
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API?pageSize=3&page=2"               # page 2
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API/17"                              # by id

curl "$API"                                              # 401, no token
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" "$API"    # 403 for a non-admin

# as an admin
JSON='Content-Type: application/json'
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" -H "$JSON" \
  -d '{"name":"COM3","type":"landmark","description":"School of Computing"}' "$API"
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" -H "$JSON" \
  -d '{"name":"Smooy","type":"store","locationId":1,"openingHours":{"opensAt":"09:00","closesAt":"17:00"}}' "$API"
curl -X PATCH -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" -H "$JSON" -d '{"description":"Frozen yoghurt"}' "$API/2"
curl -X DELETE -H "Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN" "$API/1"   # {"deletedIds":[1,2]}, Smooy goes with its landmark
```

## Run locally

With Docker, `docker compose --profile dev up -d --build` starts everything. The supplier
service is also exposed directly on `localhost:8002`.

To run it outside Docker:

1. Start the database: `docker compose --profile dev up -d supplier_db`. It listens on
   `localhost:5433`.
2. Create `.env` in this folder. `JWT_ACCESS_SECRET` must match the root `.env` so that
   tokens from the user service verify:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5433/suppliers
   JWT_ACCESS_SECRET=<same value as the root .env>
   ```

3. Apply the schema: `deno task db:init` the first time, and `deno task db:update` after
   changes.
4. Start the service: `deno task dev`.

After editing `src/prisma/contract.prisma`, run `deno task contract:emit` to regenerate
`contract.json` and `contract.d.ts`.
